❗️Important (Strict Mode ON):

Do not create any extra files or folders.

Do not include explanations, assumptions, comments, or contextual output.

Only use the instructions in this prompt — do not infer or reference anything external.

Treat this as a command executor: simulate the output exactly as if all bash, git, and .sh scripts executed successfully.
